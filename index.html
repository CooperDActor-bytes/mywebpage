    <p>G'Day from Down-Under</p>
    <p>My name is Cooper And i am 12 years old</p>
    <p>i joined the #hackathon this year (2024)</p>
    <p>i have basic-ish knowlage (did i spell that right?) of html, unity and unreal engine</p>
    <p>my friend will is joining me in this quest as he knows python, C, C+,C++ and java so a lot more than me (he also knows unity aswell)</p>
    <p>we will attempt to make a game console me (cooper) doing the hardware and will doing the software</p>
    <p>Will is an overacheiver like me and is going to make a custom os (i have been pushing him to just use a linux kernel or android but he persists.</p>
    <p>we hope to get these</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>an macbook for will as his school supplys him one but restricted as much as they could</p>
    <p>a 3d printer for our Projects</p>
    <p>a flipper zero (gotta love that dolphin)</p>
    <p>breadboards and raspberry pi's (maybe we'll see lol) </p>
    <p>a domain of course (dont want to use this bad domain if you could call it one)</p>
    <p>and a framework for me for my cryptomining (XMR) Adventure</p>
    <p>i (personally at the least) that we can get a macbook for will to let him enjoy coding (again his school laptop not great)</p>
