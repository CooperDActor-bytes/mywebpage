    <h1>A GIANT Welcome</h1>
    <p>G'Day from Down-Under</p>
    <p>My name is Cooper And i am 12 years old at the moment</p>
    <p>i've joined the #hackclub this year (2024)</p>
    <p>i have basic-ish knowledge (did i spell that right?) of html, unity and unreal engine</p>
    <p>my friend Will is joining me in this quest as he knows python, C, C+,C++ and java so a lot more than me (he also knows unity aswell).</p>
    <p>we will attempt to make a game console me (cooper) doing the hardware and Will doing the software</p>
    <p>Will is an overacheiver like me and is going to make a custom os (i have been pushing him to just use a linux kernel or android but he persists).</p>
    <p>we hope to get these</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>an macbook for Will as his school supplys him one but restricted as much as they could</p>
    <p>a 3d printer for our Projects</p>
    <p>a flipper zero (gotta love that dolphin)</p>
    <p>breadboards and raspberry pi's (maybe we'll see lol) </p>
    <p>a domain of course (dont want to use this bad domain, if you could call it one)</p>
    <p>and a framework for me for my cryptomining (XMR) Adventure</p>
    <p>i (personally at the least) that we can get a macbook for will to let him enjoy coding (again his school laptop not great)</p>
    <p>thanks Hackclub for this opportunity </p>

<h1>Coopers Quote of the week (week 2)</h1>
<p>26 June 2024</p>
<p>“Blastar" </p>
<p>In the late 1970s, the role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons became a popular obsession among the global tribe of geeks. Elon, Kimbal, and their Rive cousins immersed themselves in the game, which involves sitting around a table and, guided by character sheets and the roll of dice, embarking on fantasy adventures. One of the players serves as the Dungeon Master, refereeing the action.</p>
<p>Elon usually played the Dungeon Master and, surprisingly, did it with gentleness. “Even as a kid, Elon had a whole bunch of different demeanors and moods,” says his cousin Peter Rive. “As a Dungeon Master, he was incredibly patient, which is not, in my experience, always his default personality, if you know what I mean. It happens sometimes, and it’s so beautiful when it does.” Instead of pressuring his brother and cousins, he would turn very analytical to describe the options they had in each situation.</p>
<p>Together they entered a tournament in Johannesburg, at which they were the youngest players. The tournament’s Dungeon Master assigned their mission: you have to save this woman by figuring out who in the game is the bad guy and killing him. Elon looked at the Dungeon Master”</p>

<h1>Coopers Quote Of The Week</h1>
<p>21 June 2024</p>
  <p>“When I was reporting on Steve Jobs, his partner Steve Wozniak said that the big question to ask was Did he have to be so mean? So rough and cruel? So drama-addicted? When I turned the question back to Woz at the end of my reporting, he said that if he had run Apple, he would have been kinder. He would have treated everyone there like family and not summarily fired people. Then he paused and added, “But if I had run Apple, we may never have made the Macintosh.” And thus the question about Elon Musk: Could he have been more chill and still be the one launching us toward Mars and an electric-vehicle future?”</p>
